  <h3>How counselling can help:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Work through a long-term problem</li>
    <li>Talk through a recent experience, get a second opinion</li>
    <li>Take pressure off partners, friends or family</li>
    <li>Talk about something you don't have time or space for elsewhere</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's <em>not psychotherapy</em>: we don't diagnose or fix.<br/>
    It's <em>not coaching</em>: it's not goal-oriented &mdash; we work with what is.</p>

  <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
  <p>My approach is person-centred and integrative.
    <em>Person-centred</em> means the process is yours, and is guided by you, however you are on the day.
    <em>Integrative</em> means I work with ideas and techniques from different schools of psychology. My current training integrates systemic and cognitive-behavioural theories, while my introductory studies centred around psychoanalysis and analytical psychology. So my approach starts with a practical attitude towards thoughts, feelings and relationships, acknowledging that problems can have roots in unconscious patterns which might present existential or symbolic aspects.</p>

  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>I've worked in design, technology and music for 17 years, as a team lead, mentor, and teacher. My work involves understanding perspectives, guiding conversations, exploring complex problems and supporting peers. I always found my work with people to be the most rewarding, whether helping clients to identify and reach their goals, or helping colleagues to manage stress, complexity and relationships.</p>
  <p>My work led me to psychology, philosophy and personal development. Through journalling I became interested in my dreams, which led me to the work of C.G. Jung, and in turn to an interest in psychoanalysis, and depth psychology in general.</p>
