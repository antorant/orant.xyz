  <h3>How it can help:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Work through a long-term problem</li>
    <li>Talk through a recent experience, get a second opinion</li>
    <li>Take pressure off partners, friends or family</li>
    <li>Talk about something you don't have time or space for elsewhere</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <p>A confidential 1:1 space for listening, reflection, and perspective; conversations on the phone or online.<p>
  <p>It's <em>not psychotherapy</em>: we don't diagnose or fix.<br/>
    It's <em>not coaching</em>: it's not goal-oriented &mdash; we work with what is.

  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>I'm a lifelong student of psychology, philosophy and personal development. As life has happened, I've had to translate that intellectual interest into real emotional and psychological work. Through journalling I became interested in my dreams, which led me to the work of C.G. Jung, and in turn to an interest in psychoanalysis, and depth psychology in general.</p>
  <p>After completing introductory courses in psychoanalysis and analytical psychology, I decided to join the MA Counselling program at ThH Friedensau. I was skeptical about a religious school, but found a practical, systemic-based curriculum, and an open-minded and contemplative environment. My own philosophical attitude is influenced by eastern/ancient thought systems and comparative religion in general.</p>
  <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Fine Art, and I've worked in design, technology and music for 17 years, as a team lead, mentor, and teacher. My work involves understanding perspectives, guiding conversations, exploring complex problems and supporting peers. I always found my work with people to be the most rewarding, whether helping clients to identify and reach their goals, or helping colleagues to manage stress, complexity and relationships.</p>

  <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
  <p>My approach is <em>integrative</em> and <em>person-centred</em>.<br/><em>Integrative</em> in that I work with ideas and techniques from different schools of psychology; <em>person-centred</em> means that the process is guided by you, and we work together to find shared language and models that resonate with you.</p>
  <p>I work with the following basic principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"The talking cure": talking through one's thoughts and feelings, with an interested, objective person, is therapeutic in itself.</li>
    <li>Growth is painful, and there is no life without suffering, but there is always meaning, value and purpose to be found within.</li>
    <li>Recognising and integrating the unconscious aspects of our inner life is the key to psychological health.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Safety</h3>
  <p>I am not yet an accredited counsellor. While in training I work under supervision. It’s intended as a complement to professional psychotherapy, a more accessible alternative, or a step towards the right help.</p>
