    <p>Our work always begins with you, however you are on the day. I provide a confidential and non-judgmental space for listening and reflection, for exploring your subjective experience with an attitude of humility, patience and curiosity. Our primary material is thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and how they relate to situations and relationships in the outside world.</p>
    <p>You can use counselling as a short-term, on-demand resource for coping with acute stress or overwhelming feelings. Regular work can help you to develop resilience and a closer attunement to inner life, with potentially transformative effects on your sense of well-being, your creative work, and your relationships. Over time, the work can foster an awareness of deeper or more subtle patterns, and lead to more profound insights about oneself.</p>

    <!--<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
    <p>My background is in design, technology and music, working as a team lead, mentor and teacher. Design work is essentially about asking questions and exploring possibilities. I always found my work with people to be the most rewarding, whether helping clients to articulate a vision, or helping colleagues to manage stress and uncertainty. My work led me to psychology, philosophy and personal development. Through journalling I became interested in my dreams, which led me to the work of C.G. Jung, and in turn to an interest in psychoanalysis, and depth psychology in general.</p>-->
